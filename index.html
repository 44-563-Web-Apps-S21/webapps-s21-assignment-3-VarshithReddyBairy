        <h3>Cricket</h3>
        <p>Cricket is played between 2 teams containing 11 players each team. I like playing cricket because the rules in this 
           game are more interesting than anyother games in the world , As a <b>cricket player</b> , i would like to 
           <b>bowl , bat </b> and do <b>wicket keeping</b> . Cricket gives <b>relaxation </b> to my mind.
