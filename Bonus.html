        <h1>The Black Cat</h1>
        <p> Here comes our Super Arch nemesis . <b>The black cat</b>. The major super power of the black cats are , it the sign of death and bad luck because of their black fur just like ravens and crows. Fast-forward thousands of years – how did this fear translate over to a specifically colored domestic cat? It is believed that this superstition began around the Middle Ages in Europe. A folklore spread about a man and his son who came across a black cat, which they began to toss rocks at. The injured cat ran into a woman’s house who was suspected of being a witch and when the woman happened to appear limping and bruised the next day, people suspected that the cat must be the woman in disguise. </p>
